It's a Moore machine - it doesn't matter what transition you take to get to the final state as long as you are there.

Your representation looks good for PWGC, and the transitions that you have are correct. You're missing a bunch of possible transitions though. The idea was to represent all possible states, not just a single series of transitions that gets you to the answer. You're also missing a good representation of state transitions. As a result, your final circuit doesn't actually model the system. -45
