It's a Moore machine - it doesn't matter what transition you take to get to the final state as long as you are there. -5

Your logisim circuit is interesting! I was looking for a similar machine that could take an input from a user that specified a transition, and then decides if the system is in a final state. Your machine has a pre-programmed input that shows correct transitions to a solution with no inputs at all. Pretty cool, but not capturing the state transitions/inputs for the general problem -5
