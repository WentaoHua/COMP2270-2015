Your register file is on the right track! You need to make a few changes to make the circuit functional:

- None of the inputs should be three-state.
- The MUXes should carry 16 data bits, not 1
- Some of the MUX circuitry (especially the top MUX) is way more connected than it should be
- The DEMUX doesn't match up to the same registers as MUXes: inputting with 0010 stores in ra, not r2
- r0 should always be 0!
